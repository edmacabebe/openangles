| HTML and the WWW specs publicized | 1989-93 | By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web. URI/URL: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web. Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server (“httpd“). By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community. | [And the Internet as we know it leap-frogged man's progress in computing and enable social-networking](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-world-wide-web--webdesign-8710") |
