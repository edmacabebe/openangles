Their task was to maintain high uptime for Google (99.97%, to be exact) working with developers to ensure operations didn’t break for customers.

GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss…except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since.|[The Untold Story of Github](https://medium.com/@smhatre59/the-untold-story-of-github-132840f72f56)|

|Docker|2013|Containers exploded to popularity that containers became synonymous to the brand Docker. Just as Warden did, Docker also used LXC in its initial stages and later replaced that container manager with its own library, libcontainer. But there’s no doubt that Docker separated itself from the pack by offering an entire ecosystem for container management.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|

|Cloud Native Applications/Infrastructure|2014-16|Cloud native infrastructure is infrastructure that is hidden behind useful abstractions, controlled by APIs, managed by software, and has the purpose of running applications.

|The Importance of Container Security Is Revealed|2016|systems became more complex and risk increased, laying the groundwork for container security. Vulnerabilities like dirty COW only furthered this thinking. This led to a shift left in security along the software development lifecycle, making it a key part of each stage in container app development, also known as DevSecOps. The goal is to build secure containers from the ground up without reducing time to market.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
