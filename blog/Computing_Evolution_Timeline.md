It developed a client-server model to manage a collection of containers across multiple hosts, and Warden includes a service to manage cgroups, namespaces and the process life cycle.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|

|Springboot 1|2012-14|In October 2012, Mike Youngstrom‏ created a feature request in spring jira asking for support for containerless web application architectures in spring framework.

|Let Me Contain That For You|2013|(LMCTFY) kicked off in 2013 as an open-source version of Google's container stack, providing Linux application containers. Applications can be made “container aware,” creating and managing their own subcontainers. Active deployment in LMCTFY stopped in 2015 after Google started contributing core LMCTFY concepts to libcontainer, which is now part of the Open Container Foundation.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Docker|2013|Containers exploded to popularity that containers became synonymous to the brand Docker. Just as Warden did, Docker also used LXC in its initial stages and later replaced that container manager with its own library, libcontainer. But there’s no doubt that Docker separated itself from the pack by offering an entire ecosystem for container management.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Unikernels -> Container 2.0|2013|Unikernels were predicted to rise in the Mid 90's but was overtaken by other Technologies like Linux, VMWare and AWS EC2 at that time. What Unikernels is trying to solve are the security issues of containers, aside from the performance and size benefits. Unikernel is a relatively new concept that was re-introduced around 2013 by Anil Madhavapeddy in a paper titled “Unikernels: Library Operating Systems for the Cloud”. Unikernels are specialized, single-address-space machine images constructed by using library operating systems. |[Introduction to Unikernels](https://nordicapis.com/introduction-to-unikernels/), [Unikernels and Immutable Infrastructure](https://github.com/cetic/unikernels), [Container 2.0: Why unikernels will rock the cloud](https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/containers-20-why-unikernels-will-rock-cloud)|

In Gartner’s study, Survey Analysis: DevOps Adoption Survey Results 2015, 29% of businesses were using or piloting DevOps projects by this time. In 2014, Dr. Dave Cornelius, the globally recognized Lean and Agile catalyst, presented his doctoral research based on the Scrum value and named it as a “The Value of Scrum to Organizations”.|[DevOps Adoption](https://www.infostretch.com/blogthe-road-to-cicd-a-short-history-of-agile-development/), [The of Scrum to Organizations](https://www.knowledgehut.com/tutorials/scrum-tutorial/scrum-history)|
|Cloud Native Computing Foundation|2014-15|Google, IBM, Intel, VMware, and other tech industry leaders joined forces to create the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to steer the direction of Kubernetes, and how distributed, scale-out applications are built and supported. The creation of the CNCF further solidified cloud native as the standard model for future applications.|[Cloud Native Apps](https://www.redapt.com/cloud-native-applications-a-brief-history), [CNCF history](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/11/05/34097/)|
|Kubernetes goes mainstream|2014-16|Google decided to opensource Kubernetes. The key developers who created and extended Borg inside of Google are the same people who have created Kubernetes and who continue to be very influential in this open source project. This includes Brendan Burns, a co-founder of the Kubernetes effort; John Wilkes, principle software engineer at Google who has been working on cluster management systems there for the past eight years; Brian Grant, the technical lead of the Borg container management system, the founder of the Omega add-on to Borg to make it more flexible, and the design lead for Kubernetes; David Oppenheimer, technical lead for Kubernetes; and Eric Brewer, a vice president of infrastructure at Google and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.|[Google's 3rd Container Controller](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/03/22/decade-container-control-google/), [K8 Origin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/from-google-to-the-world-the-kubernetes-origin-story)|
|Cloud Native Applications/Infrastructure|2014-16|Cloud native infrastructure is infrastructure that is hidden behind useful abstractions, controlled by APIs, managed by software, and has the purpose of running applications.

|The Importance of Container Security Is Revealed|2016|systems became more complex and risk increased, laying the groundwork for container security. Vulnerabilities like dirty COW only furthered this thinking. This led to a shift left in security along the software development lifecycle, making it a key part of each stage in container app development, also known as DevSecOps. The goal is to build secure containers from the ground up without reducing time to market.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|

|Living on the Edge|2019|Kubernetes has massive potential for handling IoT workloads on the edge by providing a common control plane across hybrid cloud and edge environments to simplify management and operations. Within the Kubernetes IoT Edge Working Group, members of the Kubernetes and Eclipse communities are collaborating with leading technology innovators to extend Kubernetes to support dynamically, securely, and remotely managing edge nodes. A great example of this collaboration is Eclipse ioFog, a universal Edge Compute Platform which offers a standardized way to develop and remotely deploy secure microservices to edge computing devices. ioFog can be installed on any hardware running Linux and provides a universal runtime for microservices to dynamically run on the edge. Companies in different vertical markets such as retail, automotive, oil and gas, telco, and healthcare are using ioFog to turn any compute device into an edge software platform.|[How Edge and Fog take over of the traditional cloud](https://medium.com/@thinkwik/how-edge-and-fog-computing-are-taking-over-traditional-cloud-computing-b26b7276f1ce), [Fog vs Edge](https://info.opto22.com/fog-vs-edge-computing), [IoT and Fog connectivity](https://www.embedded-computing.com/embedded-computing-design/iot-and-fog-computing-connecting-any-device-to-any-cloud-over-any-network?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.embedded-computing.com%2Fprocessing=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkK_qBRD8ARIsAOteukAw09u9BWwDjK8Yqi3ssAQ5DildwP0KLHBT2NzF00hVADeJv8DPH1waApWHEALw_wcB), [Eclipse IOFog goes k8 for the Edge](https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2019/06/23/eclipse-iofog-delivering-k8s-at-the-edge/)|
