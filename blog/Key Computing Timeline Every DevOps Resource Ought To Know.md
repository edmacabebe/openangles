It is also commonly called a URL; HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web}|[Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server (“httpd“). By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-world-wide-web--webdesign-8710")|

|Jails is realised in FreeBSD|2000|The introduction of Jails in FreeBSD achieved clear-cut separation between its services and those of its customers for security and ease of administration. FreeBSD Jails allows administrators to partition a FreeBSD computer system into several independent, smaller systems – called “jails” – with the ability to assign an IP address for each system and configuration.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|

|Process Containers|2006-07|Launched by Google was designed for limiting, accounting and isolating resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) of a collection of processes. It was renamed “Control Groups (cgroups)” a year later and eventually merged to Linux kernel 2.6.24.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|LXC|2008|was the first, most complete implementation of Linux container manager. It utilizes cgroups and Linux namespaces, and it works on a single Linux kernel without requiring any patches|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Warden|2011|CloudFoundry started developing Warden. Warden can isolate environments on any operating system, running as a daemon and providing an API for container management. It developed a client-server model to manage a collection of containers across multiple hosts, and Warden includes a service to manage cgroups, namespaces and the process life cycle.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Let Me Contain That For You|2013|(LMCTFY) kicked off in 2013 as an open-source version of Google's container stack, providing Linux application containers. Applications can be made “container aware,” creating and managing their own subcontainers. Active deployment in LMCTFY stopped in 2015 after Google started contributing core LMCTFY concepts to libcontainer, which is now part of the Open Container Foundation.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Docker|2013|Containers exploded to popularity that containers became synonymous to the brand Docker. Just as Warden did, Docker also used LXC in its initial stages and later replaced that container manager with its own library, libcontainer. But there’s no doubt that Docker separated itself from the pack by offering an entire ecosystem for container management.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|The Importance of Container Security Is Revealed|2016|systems became more complex and risk increased, laying the groundwork for container security. Vulnerabilities like dirty COW only furthered this thinking. This led to a shift left in security along the software development lifecycle, making it a key part of each stage in container app development, also known as DevSecOps. The goal is to build secure containers from the ground up without reducing time to market.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Cloud Native Computing Foundation|2017|Containers became mature. Ceph and REX-Ray set standards for container storage, while Flannel connects millions of containers across datacenters. And in CI/CD, Jenkins is completely changing the way we build and deploy apps.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
