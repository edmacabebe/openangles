|Warden|2011|CloudFoundry started developing Warden. Warden can isolate environments on any operating system, running as a daemon and providing an API for container management. It developed a client-server model to manage a collection of containers across multiple hosts, and Warden includes a service to manage cgroups, namespaces and the process life cycle.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Let Me Contain That For You|2013|(LMCTFY) kicked off in 2013 as an open-source version of Google's container stack, providing Linux application containers. Applications can be made “container aware,” creating and managing their own subcontainers.

|Docker|2013|Containers exploded to popularity that containers became synonymous to the brand Docker. Just as Warden did, Docker also used LXC in its initial stages and later replaced that container manager with its own library, libcontainer. But there’s no doubt that Docker separated itself from the pack by offering an entire ecosystem for container management.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Cloud Native Computing Foundation|2015|Google, IBM, Intel, VMware, and other tech industry leaders joined forces to create the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to steer the direction of Kubernetes, and how distributed, scale-out applications are built and supported.

|The Importance of Container Security Is Revealed|2016|systems became more complex and risk increased, laying the groundwork for container security. Vulnerabilities like dirty COW only furthered this thinking. This led to a shift left in security along the software development lifecycle, making it a key part of each stage in container app development, also known as DevSecOps. The goal is to build secure containers from the ground up without reducing time to market.|[A brief history of containers](https://blog.aquasec.com/a-brief-history-of-containers-from-1970s-chroot-to-docker-2016)|
|Kubernetes goes mainstream|2014-16|Google decided to opensource Kubernetes. The key developers who created and extended Borg inside of Google are the same people who have created Kubernetes and who continue to be very influential in this open source project. This includes Brendan Burns, a co-founder of the Kubernetes effort; John Wilkes, principle software engineer at Google who has been working on cluster management systems there for the past eight years; Brian Grant, the technical lead of the Borg container management system, the founder of the Omega add-on to Borg to make it more flexible, and the design lead for Kubernetes; David Oppenheimer, technical lead for Kubernetes; and Eric Brewer, a vice president of infrastructure at Google and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.|[Google's 3rd Container Controller](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/03/22/decade-container-control-google/), [K8 Origin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/from-google-to-the-world-the-kubernetes-origin-story)|
|Cloud Native Applications/Infrastructure|2014-16|Cloud native infrastructure is infrastructure that is hidden behind useful abstractions, controlled by APIs, managed by software, and has the purpose of running applications. Running infrastructure with these traits gives rise to a new pattern for managing that infrastructure in a scalable, efficient way.|[Cloud Native Infrastructure](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-infrastructure/9781491984291/ch01.html), [Cloud Native Applications](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps)|
